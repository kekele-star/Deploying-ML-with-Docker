# Deploying ML with Docker

This repository contains a comprehensive guide and codebase for deploying machine learning models using Docker.

## Overview

Deploying machine learning models requires a robust infrastructure that ensures consistency and scalability. Docker provides a containerized environment, allowing seamless deployment across various platforms. This project focuses on streamlining the deployment process for machine learning models using Docker.

## Features

- **Containerized Environment**: Utilizes Docker to encapsulate the machine learning model and its dependencies.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Offers a scalable solution for deploying ML models in various environments.
- **Ease of Use**: Provides a straightforward guide and codebase for easy understanding and implementation.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Clone the Repository**
